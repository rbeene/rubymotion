Don't get me wrong, I think Objective-C is a great language. I've enjoyed using it nearly every day for the past four years and it's getting better all the time. But I find working in Ruby to be just plain fun. If you've tried projects in Ruby and just didn't like it, RubyMotion probably won't change your mind. But if you've ever wanted to make iOS or Mac apps but didn't want to get over the hump that is Objective-C, maybe this will get you going."

I wouldn’t consider myself an Objective-C developer over, lets say, a Ruby developer or C# developer. I’m simply a developer that likes to learn. When a client brought in an idea that needed an iOS app, I wrote it in Objective-C with Xcode like a good boy. The size of the app made it perfect to rewrite in RubyMotion which gave me a chance to compare and contrast."
